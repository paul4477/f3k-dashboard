# f3k-dashboard

The aim of this project is to provide an interface to event info stored on F3XVault while integrating live round and group info from GliderScore's digital timer.
Its intended to be used at the flying field on a mobile device.

The first release aims to provide:

 - Event selection (currently filtered to just UK F3K events)
 - View of round/group info - to easily answer the perpetual questions of "What group am I in?"
 - View of live round timer with details of prep-time, task, flying vs non-flying time, landing window etc
 - End of round time submission
 - Basic view of current standings, updated each round

As this is designed for use at UK F3K league events it only supports F3K and can only manage one live timer feed at once.
